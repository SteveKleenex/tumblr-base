## Tumblr Base
A starting point for **Tumblr theme development**. The code and
guidelines are based on my own requirements. Post logic is not included as this
is unique to the theme.

#### Options
- Wrap these in the block `{block:Hidden}`so they don't appear in the rendered HTML.
- Use Global Apperance options to maintain an unified experience.
- By design, Booleans, are switches. Don't prefix with *enable* or *disable*.

#### CSS
- Seperate core from options driven CSS. 

#### Localisation
- Use localised `strings` if you need to include non standard text in a theme.

#### Comments
- Add comments when needed. Its sensible to wrap these in the block `{block:Hidden}`
so they don't appear in the rendered HTML.
